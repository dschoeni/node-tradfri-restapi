# node-tradfri-restapi

What
---
A simple REST-API implementation of [node-tradfri-argon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-tradfri-argon) with the following commands

 - `/tradfri/deviceids` will provide an array of device ids
 - `/tradfri/groupids` will provide an array of group ids
 - `/tradfri/devices` will provide a full list of all devices including meta data
 - `/tradfri/groups` will provide a full list of all groups including devices and meta data
 - `/tradfri/device/:deviceid/:state` will set the state of a device (on/off). E.g. /tradfri/device/17101/on
 -  `/tradfri/group/:groupid/:state` will set the state of a device (on/off). E.g. /tradfri/device/11007/off

First release is a bit of a quick one. Exceptions needs to be managed and include toggle as an option. I did the API as I need to control my IKEA TRÃ…DFRI-lights with Node-RED but Node-RED does not support Node v7.x (I assume it will wait for the next LTS release) and a simple micro service is the short term solution to have it integrated and managed by Node-RED.
